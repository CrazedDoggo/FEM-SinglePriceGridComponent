## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I tried to build this when I was much newer to building layouts and managed to do quite poorly, especially with the media queries. Now, after finishing my course about Grid and gaining more experience, it was much easier and I definitely improved.

Aside from extra practice with layouts, I learned how to utilize box-shadows in an easy manner.

```css
    box-shadow:  0px 0px 10px -5px black;
```

Simply put, the values represent our x-offset, y-offset, blur radius, spread, and color respectively.

### Continued development

Continue planning and using grid for the main layout as well as box shadows to give certain elements some flair. Nothing major, should be fun getting into more complex projects after this.

### Useful resources

- [Box Shadows](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This very much helped with understanding box-shadows in a simple, clean manner.
